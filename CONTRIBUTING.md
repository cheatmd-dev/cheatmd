Thanks for your interest in contributing.

## Getting started

git clone https://github.com/cheatmd-dev/cheatmd.git
cd cheatmd
go build ./cmd/cheatmd
go test ./...
```

Requires Go 1.26+.

## Making changes

## Code style

- Keep functions focused and small.
- Add tests for new logic, especially in `pkg/parser` and `pkg/linter`.
- Preserve existing comments and docstrings unless they are wrong.

## Reporting bugs

Open an issue with:

- What you ran (command, flags, config).
- What you expected.
- What happened instead.
- OS and Go version.

## Feature requests

Open an issue describing the use case. If you have a cheat file that shows
the problem or the desired behavior, include it.

## Wiki

Documentation lives in the [Wiki](https://github.com/cheatmd-dev/cheatmd/wiki).
If you spot an error or want to add a recipe, open a PR against the wiki
repo or mention it in an issue.
